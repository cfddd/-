## 聚合函数
```sql
use sql_invoicing;

select 
	max(invoice_total) as highest,
    min(invoice_total) as lowest,
    avg(invoice_total) as average,
    sum(invoice_total) as total,
    sum(invoice_total * 10) as total_10,		-- 可以使用表达式
    count(invoice_total) as number_of_invoices,
    count(payment_date) as count_of_payments,	-- 返回的是非空的记录数量
    count(*) as total_records,
    count(distinct client_id) as total_records	-- 得到唯一值
from invoices
where invoice_date > '2019-07-01';

```

```sql

select
	'First half of 2019' as date_range,
    sum(invoice_total) as total_sales,
    sum(payment_total) as total_payments,
    sum(invoice_total) - sum(payment_total) as what_we_expect
from invoices
where invoice_date < '2019-07-01'
union
select
	'Seoncd half of 2019' as date_range,
    sum(invoice_total) as total_sales,
    sum(payment_total) as total_payments,
    sum(invoice_total) - sum(payment_total) as what_we_expect
from invoices
where invoice_date > '2019-07-01'
union
select
	'Total' as date_range,
    sum(invoice_total) as total_sales,
    sum(payment_total) as total_payments,
    sum(invoice_total) - sum(payment_total) as what_we_expect
from invoices
    
```
## group by
给数据分组，更好的统计聚合函数使用
```sql
select
	client_id,
	sum(invoice_total) as total_sales
from invoices
where invoice_date >= '2019-07-01'
group by client_id
order by total_sales desc
```
> **注意：必须按照`from` `where` `group by` `order by`的顺序写语句，否则会报错

```sql
select
	state,
    city,
	sum(invoice_total) as total_sales
from invoices i
join clients using (client_id)
group by state,city
```

```sql
select
	date,
    pm.name as payment_methon,
    sum(amount) as total_payments
from payments p
join payment_methods pm
	on p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
group by date
order by date
```
## having
不能使用where，因为total_sales是在分组之后才有的。
having专属在group之后，可以实现这个需求
**先使用Where子句,再使用Having子句**
```sql
select 
	client_id,
    sum(invoice_total) as total_sales
from invoices
-- where total_sales > 500		-- 不能使用where，因为total_sales是在分组之后才有的
group by client_id
having total_sales > 500
```
having 中还可以使用复合判断语句。
```sql
select 
	client_id,
    sum(invoice_total) as total_sales,
    count(*) as number_of_invoices
from invoices
-- where total_sales > 500		-- 不能使用where，因为total_sales是在分组之后才有的
group by client_id
having total_sales > 500 and number_of_invoices > 5
```



```sql
-- Get the customers
-- located in Virginia
-- who have spent more than $100

use sql_store;

select 
	first_name,
    sum(quantity*unit_price) as total_fee
from customers
join orders o using(customer_id)
join order_items oi using(order_id)
where state = 'VA'
group by customer_id
having total_fee > 100
```

## with rollup
`GROUP BY …… WITH ROLL UP` 自动汇总型分组，若是多字段分组的话汇总也会是多层次的，注意这是**MySQL扩展语法**，不是SQL标准语法
```sql
use sql_invoicing;

select
	client_id,
    sum(invoice_total) as total_sales
from invoices 
group by client_id with rollup;
```

```sql
select
	name as payment_method,
    sum(p.amount) as total
from payments p
join payment_methods pm 
	on pm.payment_method_id = p.payment_method
where payment_method in (1,2)
group by pm.name with rollup
```
